Provides balancers and sorters to the game that do not require electricity to operate.

# How to install

> :warning: **You will need to start a new game to play this mod. This is a restriction of CoI.**

Download the latest release: https://github.com/NotoriousPyro/UnpoweredBalancers/releases

1. From the downloaded zip, copy the contents of the `Mods` folder to your Captain of Industry `Mods` folder.

    By default, this is `Documents\Captain of Industry\Mods`. You can find out where exactly by running the following in PowerShell:
    ```powershell
    ((new-object -COM Shell.Application).Namespace(0x05).Self.Path + '\Captain of Industry\Mods')
    ```

2. Verify inside 'Mods' folder, each sub-folder has **a dll file with the same name as the folder**, it is fine if other DLLs are also present.

3. Enable the `Enable mods` options in the ingame settings.

4. Start a new game!

# How to use

After research, simply place them down as you would a normal balancer/sorter.
